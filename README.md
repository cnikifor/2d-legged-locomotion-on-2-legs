# 2d-legged-locomotion-on-2-legs
Spring-Loaded Inverted Pendulum (SLIP) model for simulating the locomotion of a two-legged robot in 2D, by capturing the dynamics and kinematics of a point mass at the top of spring-damper legs. The simulation is developed in Python, and a script for animating the gaits is also included. 

# Description
Success in designing a hexapod robot lies fundamentally in the physical characteristics of the legs, such as their length, spring stiffness, or damping coefficient. Thus, it is of paramount importance to choose a compliant leg design that offers a broad range of movements and enables the robot to complete various gaits. To obtain the kinematics of the robot, this study uses the Spring-Loaded Inverted Pendulum (SLIP) model to simulate a two-legged robot’s gait in 2D, by capturing the dynamics of a point mass at the top of spring-damper legs. The simulation is developed in Python, and a script for animating the locomotion of the system is also included. Specifically, after defining the functions for the governing equations of motion, the time-varying position of the point mass during flight or stance is approximated. The program allows the experimentation of different inputs, such as the legs’ spring stiffness or touchdown angle, and each time generates position data that describe the robot’s gait. Overall, this simulation can be developed into an intuitive tool that uses the SLIP model as the basis for designing a robust robot with locomotion on compliant legs.

The two-legged robot is modelled as a system consisting of a rigid body with mass $m$, connected to two massless legs. The legs, in turn, are modelled as two separate spring-damper systems, with a natural length $l_0$, a spring stiffness $K$, and a damping coefficient $C$. The strength of gravity is $g$. The dynamics of the system is described by vector $\vec{q} = [x, y, v_x, v_y]$, where x and y are the coordinates of the time-varying position of the body with respect to the support leg, while $v_x$ and $v_y$ are the $x$ and $y$ components of the body’s velocity. There are three different phases during the robot's gait: the flight phase, the single stance phase and the double stance phase. The derivation of the Equations of Motion for each phase is achieved with the use of Newton’s Laws by taking into consideration the changing direction of each force acting on the body due to the springs and dampers.

# Getting Started
## Dependencies
For the program to run, the following libraries/sub-packages need to be imported:
* [numpy](https://numpy.org/)
* [scipy.integrate](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/tutorial/integrate.html)
* [matplotlib.pyplot](https://matplotlib.org/3.5.3/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.html)
* [matplolib.patches](https://matplotlib.org/3.5.3/api/patches_api.html)
* [matplolib.animation](https://matplotlib.org/3.5.3/api/animation_api.html)

## Executing Program
* Within the SLIP_class, the overall SLIP physics model is defined since it contains the solutions to the differential equations of motion for each phase as well as the event functions which could cause the termination of a phase. There are class variables which remain constant during the span of the simulation. These parameters refer to characteristics of the spring-damper legs, such as their spring stiffness $K$, damping coefficient $C$, and natural length $l_0$. The coordinates of the ground profile and the touchdown angles for each leg are also defined as class variables. All these constant class variables can be altered by the user.
*  Within the Simulation script, the "simulation" function is defined; the user can input the initial conditions $\vec{q_0}$. These initial conditions are imported as instance variables while calling the SLIP_class. Then, based on the initial conditions, the system starts with a specific phase, and consecutively shifts between phases until the simulation stops. Each time a phase occurs, the data generated by the numerical integration are stored in an array, called sim_data. In the end, the sim_data is plotted which showcases the x-y position of the robot's point mass in 2D space.
*  In the Animation script, the user calls the simulation function which returns the sim_data. The sim_data, in turn, is used to animate the gait of the robot.
