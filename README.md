# 2d-legged-locomotion-on-2-legs
Spring-Loaded Inverted Pendulum (SLIP) model for simulating locomotion of a two-legged robot in 2D, by capturing the dynamics of a point mass at the top of spring-damper legs. The simulation is developed in Python, and a script for animating the gaits is also included.
